Hi, my name is Rani! This is my setup, it's not that much but I use it mostly for note-taking and godot. I use neovim for both because why not LOL. The goal of this setup is to be minimalistic as possible without adding too much aesthetic. This setup is specifically for windows but if you're interested you can tweak it to your needs. I'm planning on migrating to linux anytime soon but the only thing that is holding me back is my workflow ecosystem (apps that aren't available on linux) and storage. I also use wezterm as my terminal emulator because it looks cool LOL! I cuztomized it as well, lmk what you think about it.
